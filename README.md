Most of the code is made in javascript, but in order to run the bot you must have a discord account and create a server and then add the bot.

Discord register: https://discord.com/register
Discord tutorial to create a server: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/204849977-How-do-I-create-a-server
Invitation url for the bot: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1150906817237500055&permissions=8&scope=bot

To be able to run the bot you have to start a new terminal and put 
"npm install"
